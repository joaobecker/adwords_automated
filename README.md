# AdWords Automated - Using Data Science in AdWords

In this project we will go over on how to use Data Science to automate and take your AdWords campaign to a whole new level.

As a marketer working for an agency, I hated when we had big clients asking us to create AdWords for their entire website. As most of the job was to perform dull and manual entries. So, to make my life easier, more enjoyable and to perform less mistakes, I used my new Data Science skills to automate my work.

This project will show you, step-by-step, how I did that and how you can do it too. All you need is basic understand of Python and CSS as I will go over with as much detail as possible, so you can apply this project on your work today and impress your boss!
