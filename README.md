# AdWords Automated - Using Data Science in AdWords

In this project, we go over on how to use Data Science to automate your AdWords campaign and take it to a whole new level. 

As a marketer working for an agency, I hated when big clients came to us to create AdWords for their entire website, as most of the job was performing dull and long manual entries. So, to make my life easier, my job more enjoyable and to perform fewer mistakes, I used my Data Science skills to automate my work.

This project shows you, step-by-step, how I did it and how you can do it too. All you need is a basic understanding of Python and CSS.
